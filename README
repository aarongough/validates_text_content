validates_text_content
======================

validates_text_content is a Rails plugin that provides an ActiveRecord validation for
determining whether or not a block of English text meets certain quality standards.

It is designed to help ease the moderation load associated with administering a community 
website and aims to provide instant feedback to users who might otherwise have their 
content deleted or edited by a moderator.


Examples
========

Rejects:
    "this comment has absolutely no capitalization."
    "This comment has no type of punctuation"
    "Fdkjd dk dkkjhd kjdhkjd kjdhdhdl alkasla lka alk"
    "THIS COMMENT IS ALL IN UPPERCASE. ME NO WANT!"
    "Thiscommenthasabsolutelynospacesthereisnowaythisisgood."
    "THIS COMMENT is MORE THAN 80% CAPITALS."
    "THIS pERSON hAS tHEIR cAPS-lOCK oN."
    
Accepts:
    "This is a very simple test comment."
    "Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious: a super long word!"
    "How many words can I think of that don't contain an 'e'?"
    
For more examples please see the test cases in 'test/validates_text_content_test.rb'.
